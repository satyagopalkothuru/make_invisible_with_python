# make_invisible_with_python
Hello friends, I have tried a new concept today with openCV in python. In this i have tried this magic with computer vision  to make myself invisible when i am in front of my laptop camera. Hope you know about "Harry Potter's Invisible Cloak"(Check with internet with this link www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgdoZFIFZs).
